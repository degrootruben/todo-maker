# ToDo Maker [![Latest release](https://latest-release-svg.herokuapp.com/latest-release.svg)](https://github.com/degrootruben/todo-maker/releases)

ToDo Maker is a web app that lets you create your own task list! 

ToDo Maker is a project I am working on to learn the basics of Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Mongoose, software development in general and all the other librariers, frameworks and tools that come along with it.

## Installing ToDo Maker
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/degrootruben/todo-maker.git`.
2. Use `npm install`, in the repo you just cloned, to install the dependencies.
3. Remove the `.example` extension of the `.env.example` file and open the resulting `.env` file. In the file you put your MongoDB-database-URI after `DB_URI=` and put a JWT secret after `JWT_SECRET=`. Your JWT secret should be a strong password to sign your JWT's.
4. Start the project by using `node app.js` in the repo's folder.
