# ToDo Maker [![Latest release](https://latest-release-svg.herokuapp.com/latest-release-todo-maker.svg)](https://github.com/degrootruben/todo-maker/releases)

ToDo Maker is a webapp that lets you create your own task list! 

ToDo Maker is a project I am working on to learn the basics of Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Mongoose, software development in general and all the other librariers, frameworks and tools that come along with it.

## Installing ToDo Maker
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/degrootruben/todo-maker.git`.
2. Use `npm install`, in the repo you just cloned, to install the dependencies.
3. Remove the `.example` extension of the `.env.example` file and open the resulting `.env` file. In the file you put your MongoDB-database-URI after `DB_URI=` and put a JWT secret after `JWT_SECRET=`. Your JWT secret should be a strong password to sign your JWT's.
4. Start the project by using `node app.js` in the repo's folder.

## The project
The idea of this project started when I finished the [Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Qk8SG5Ms&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU) course by The Net Ninja. This course did not only lay the foundation for this project but also sparked my interest in web development. In addition to this I used the [Node.js Auth Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnoAwLP1a-0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iqqESP8335DA5cRFp8loyp) course by The Net Ninja to learn about authentication with JWTs in Node.js. To refresh my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I watched some more YouTube tutorials. For other questions I mostly used StackOverflow (of course) and Reddit, they both helped me out a lot. This lead to this project at it's current state. 

To display the newest release image in the title of this README-file I had to create an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/latest-release-svg-github). It's called [latest-release-svg-github](https://github.com/degrootruben/latest-release-svg-github), or LRSG. This is my first NPM package.
